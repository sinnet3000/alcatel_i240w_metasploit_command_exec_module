# Alcatel Lucent I-240W - Reverse TCP MIPS payload via HTTP remote execution

This is a Metasploit module I developed for being able to exploit a remote execution vulnerability in Alcatel I240W ONT. They are used by a big ISP in Mexico.

In depth information about the remote execution vulnerability is here: http://www.websec.mx/advisories/view/Ejecuci%C3%B3n-de-comandos-en-Alcatel-Lucent-I-240W-Q

A demo video is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHH2lhC34PY
